# Artificial Intelligence for Health
The labs for the course Artifical Intelligence for Health teached at Halmstad University.

## Lab 1
Classification task of three different types of brain scans (cognitively normal, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment) using CNNs.

## Lab 2
The main focus was to use EXplainable AI (XAI) in order to learn what a CNN network had learned in order to classify brain images as cognitively normal or brains of Alzheimer's disease.

## Lab 3
Construction of an LSTM network to predict movement in the Halmstad Intelligent Home (HINT) based on sensorvalues.
